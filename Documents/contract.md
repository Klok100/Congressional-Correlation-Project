# Team Contract #

## Communication ##

  1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 5-7 PM at Grainger Library 4th Floor. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, who will be responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following weekâ€™s meeting.

  2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails and messages within 24 hours.

  3. **Respect** Each team member's opinion is to be valued by the other members and when ideas are brought up, we will come to a full agreement before proceeding. Rejection of one's idea must be done so with a valid reason and a potential alternative.

## Collaboration ##

  1. **Work Distribution** We will distribute tasks based on each member's strong suits and weaknesses. If no task is assigned, that member is to create unit and integration tests to ensure the functionality of previously written code. We will try our best to distribute tasks as evenly as possible, and if workload related issues arise, we will discuss those issues as a group accordingly.

  2. **Time Commitment** Each member must commit 3-4 hours weekly on their assigned tasks and must notify others should conflict(s) arise. If a member fails to complete a given task(s), they are to make it up in the following week. To make up for a lack of task completion, a member may contribute significantly more to the final report/presentation to make up for the work others needed to pick up on their behalf. If an indivual is unable to meet during our preassigned time (5-7 PM on Tuesdays), they must do their best to alert the other group member as early as possible. We will then decide, as group, on what to do on a case-by-case basis.

  3. **Conflict Resolution** If a conflict arises, we will gather all group members to discuss the issue and how to proceed. Conflicts relating to indivisual members are to be brought up to the indivisual first, to allow them to resolve it before course staff is informed. We will alert our assigned TA if there arises persisting issues such as consistently being late or not completing assigned tasks in a timely fashion. Since this is a team project, we will all do our best to be understanding and respectful to the others in our group. Alerting course staff about issues is reserved as a last resort option.
